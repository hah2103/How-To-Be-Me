1. Needed. You will need to identify what harddrive and connectors your computer is using, either Sata or IDE.</br>
You can find this information in your computer's manual.Once you've identified your harddrive you will need to </br>
buy the drive you would like to replace.

2. Backup. It is great practice to always backup your computer whenever you plan to make any major changes.</br>
I tipically use one of my extra harddrives in my external harddrive hub when I backup the data on my PC. However,</br>
there are many different ways to backup your computer.You can find out more here: <a href "http://www.wikihow.com/Back-up-a-Computer">http://www.wikihow.com/Back-up-a-Computer</a></br>

<p>
3. Open your Case. Before opening my desktops's case, I first unplug its power cord and cycle the power button</br>
Precausions must always be taken when working inside of a computer. To open my computer case I must first untwist</br>
a few screws then I can slide the covering off of the case. SO as not to damage any electrical component within your</br>
case, it is always recommended that you uses an anti-electrostatic wrist wrap or ground your self to the PC with occasion</br>
touches to the case's frame or power supply.

<p>
4. Remove & replace. To remove my harddrive I first unplugged the connecters and then unscrewed a few fasteners</br>
theat held it in place. Once out, you can replace your old harddrive with the new one.
