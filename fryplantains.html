1. Needed. You will need plaintains,of course. Not bananas, like what the Technical Writing Monkey eats, but plaintains</br>
YOu will also need a frying pan, knife, and oil (I use vegetable oil).

<p>
2. Cut. Use your knife to cut your plantains, after peeling them. How you cut them is usually up to your preference</br>
You can cut them to form circles or, as we usually do back in Jamaica, cut them diagonally to form what you see in the picture</br>

<p>
3. Fry. Place your frying pan onto the stove and pour enough oil into the pan that rises about 1/2 an inch up the pan's sides</br>
 Once the oil has heated add your sliced plaintains. You will need to flip your plaintains to ensure neither side burns, until</br>
both sides have reached golden perfect!

<p>
4. Enjoy! Plaintains can go with just about any other dish or by themselves as a dilicious snack.
